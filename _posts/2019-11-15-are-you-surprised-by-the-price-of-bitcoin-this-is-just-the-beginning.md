[This is just the beginning][6].
[Bitcoin][7] is a very new technology, even though the concept that it brings to life is decades old. The _Double Spending Problem_ has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital certificate to stand in the place of money and be sure that no one else can spend that certificate other than you as long as you hold it. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the full implications of which are not yet completely understood, and for which the tools to exploit it do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea.
This new technology requires radical new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email didn't correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed, and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous.

[比特币][7]从出现到现在虽然已经过了十多年，但是它背后所使用的技术，一直到今天仍然还是非常新颖的。_双花问题_的解决，意味着可以使用“数字证书”来代替金钱，并且只要您持有证书，那么除了您以外，其它任何人都不能花这个钱。这是史无前例的一个范式转换，它所蕴含的意义，还不能完全被人全部理解，并且目前也没有可用的工具能充分利用这一新思想。

当开发基于企业应用时，新技术需要有激进的新思维。如同电子邮件的顶级供应商一样，虽然他们已经经营了很多年，但他们并没能正确地理解这项服务。有关比特币新的正确的思想是不可或缺的，而且在未来，这些新的思想还会进一步显现出来。使得这项新技术能够充分发挥其潜力，并且无处不在。

![原来的 Hotmail 界面][9]原来的 Hotmail 界面

Hotmail used familiar technologies (the browser and email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been superseded by web interfaces and email "in the cloud" that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage.

Hotmail 使用已经成熟的技术（浏览器和电子邮件）设计了一种访问和传输邮件的更佳模式；使用　Outlook Express　这样的邮件客户端想法已经　Web 界面所取代，与专用的客户端相比，在“云端”的电子邮件比使用将邮件保存在自己的本地存储中的专用客户端具有更多的优势。

Bitcoin, which will completely transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about Bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other, but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. These fundamental innovations are not simple substitutions or one dimensional improvements of existing ideas or services.

比特币将彻底改变转账的方式，它需要以自己的方式被理解，而不仅仅是作为一种在线货币的形式。将比特币视为货币，就像将电子邮件视为另一种邮寄信件的形式一样荒谬；电子邮件不仅仅是取代了邮寄信件，而且它还深刻地改变了人们发送和使用信息的方式。这些重大创新并不是对原有事物的简单的替换，或是对现有的想法或服务进行一维的改进。

As I have explained previously, [**Bitcoin is not money**][10]. Bitcoin is [**_a protocol_**][11]. If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can put Bitcoin in a proper context, which will allow you to make rational suggestions about the sorts of services that might be profitable based on it.

正如我之前所解释的，[**比特币不是货币**][10]。比特币是[一种协议][11]。如果你这样看待，加上正确的假设，你可以把比特币放在一个适当的环境中，才能让你对基于它的可能盈利的各类服务提出合理的建议。

![][13]
Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilized nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights.

比特币的每个部分都是文档。它始终是文档，在任何时候都是。这是事实，作为文档，它受到文明国家宪法中言论自由条款的保护，这些宪法保证了有保障的、不可撤销的权利。

If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money, then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it should not be the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an "Email Exchange" to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin.

如果比特币是一种协议，而不是货币，那么，建立模仿现实世界货币、股票和大宗商品交易进行比特币交易的货币交易所，不应该是发现比特币价格的唯一手段。你不会设置一个“电子邮件交换”来发现电子邮件服务的价值，同样的事情也适用于比特币。

Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your 'letter'. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internets, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on the screen of your recipient's machine, which can be literally any device, from a wristwatch to a laptop a smartphone or a desktop.

#!
按照这个思路，当你在　Gmail　账户上输入邮件时，你是在输入你的“信件”。你按下发送键，它通过你的　ISP，通过互联网，进入你收件人的I　SP，然后它被输出到你收件人的屏幕上，可以是任何设备，从手表到笔记本电脑，智能手机或桌面电脑。

The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the Bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your [value across the globe][14] to its recipient it needs to be 'read out', i.e. turned _back into money_, in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email.

比特币同样如此；你通过项服务在一端输入货币，然后将比特币发送给你的接收者，没有中间人来处理转账。一旦比特币完成了它的工作，将你的(价值)[14]在全球范围内转移到它的接收者那里，它就需要被“读出”，也就是把_back变成钱币，就像你的信件在电子邮件中显示给它的接收者一样。

比特币也是如此;你通过一项服务在一端输入货币，然后将比特币发送给你的接收者，没有中间人来处理转账。一旦比特币[在全球范围内将你的价值][14]传递给它的接收者，它就需要被“读出”，也就是_变成货币_，就像你的信件在电子邮件中显示给它的接收者一样。

In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the block chain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of Bitcoin is _services _or _goods _not Bitcoin itself.

在电子邮件场景中，一旦转移发生，您收到的电子邮件将其信息传递给您，它除了作为发送的信息的记录(会计)之外没有其他用途，您可以将该信息存档。比特币在区块链上为你做账，基于它的良好服务将为你在本地存储扩展的交易细节，但作为比特币的接收者，你需要的是_服务_或_商品_，而不是比特币本身。

This will remain true until Bitcoin is preferred over money, since it has more utility than money. This event is called, "The Transformation", where Bitcoin is chosen over fiat money because it is more useful than money.

在比特币取代货币之前，这种情况仍将存在，因为比特币的效用大于货币。这一事件被称为“转型”，人们选择比特币而不是法币，因为它比货币更有用。

Bitcoin's true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding onto it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will become valuable in the future; it doesn't make any sense. Of course, you **_can_** hold onto Bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value **_will_**_ _go up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all Bitcoin economy gets under way.

比特币的真正本质是作为一种全球任何地方的即时支付方式(尽管不是货币)。它不是一种投资，持有它并希望它会变得有价值，就像持有电子邮件或 PDF 文件并希望它在未来会变得有价值一样；这没有任何意义。当然，你可以持有比特币，看着它的价值上涨，它的价值也_必然会_上涨，但你需要有勇气，在向全比特币经济过渡的过程中，经受住买卖的剧烈波动。

Remember also that businesses that have a need to store Bitcoin need to be concerned about its value if their models are open-ended and are exposed to the market. "Closed Circuit Bitcoin" models have control over everything and never need to worry about prices at exchanges. They can do all their business moving an unlimited amount of fiat with just a few Bitcoin.

还请记住，需要持有比特币的企业也需要关注其价值，如果它们的模型是开放式的，并在市场公开。“闭环的比特币”模型可以控制一切，而无需担心交易所的价格。他们只需几枚比特币就可以移动无限量的法币。

Despite the fact that you can't double spend them and each one is unique, Bitcoin has no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value; they're always the same, no matter what anyone thinks about them, like math itself. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because _it behaves like money_, due to the fact it cannot be double spent. Misrepresentation of Bitcoin's true nature has masked Bitcoin's dual nature of being digital and not double-spendable.

尽管你不能把比特币花费两次，而且每一笔都是独一无二的，但与书籍或任何实物不同，比特币没有内在价值。它们不能升值；它们总是一样的，不管别人怎么想，就像数学本身一样。因为比特币用起来跟货币一样，关于比特币的错误思想已经传播开来，因为它不能被重复使用。对比特币真实性质的误解掩盖了比特币的数字化和不可重复消费（双花）的双重特性。

Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a gum?
旋转木马。它们开始是糖果，然后结束是口香糖。在你咀嚼它们之前，它们是什么?糖果还是口香糖?

Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it.

比特币是数字化的，具有信息的所有品质，使得信息不稀缺。它处于一个物质世界的商品和无限丰富的数字信息世界之间摇摆新的新地方，只属于数字世界，但具有两者的特征。这就是为什么它被广泛误解，以及为什么需要一种新的思维来围绕它设计业务。

All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying Bitcoin at the exchanges **doesn't matter for the consumer. **If the cost of buying a Bitcoin goes to 1¢ This doesn't change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your Bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the Bitcoin when you started the process.

所有这些都在一定程度上解释了为什么在交易所购买比特币的价格对消费者来说并不重要。如果购买一个比特币的成本是1美分，这并不会改变转账另一端的金额。只要你把比特币兑换成商品或货币后立即赎回，那么无论你在开始兑换过程时支付了多少钱，在另一端都会产生相同的价值。

Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with [zip][17]. The size of a document file when it is "zipped" can be [up to 87% smaller][18] than the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of Bitcoin at an exchange.

这样想吧。让我们假设您想要向另一个人发送一个长文本文件。您可以按原样发送它，也可以用zip压缩它。文档文件“压缩”后的大小可以比原始文件小87%。当我们把这个想法转换成比特币时，压缩比就是比特币在交易所的价格。

If a Bitcoin is $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 Bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of Bitcoin is 1¢ then you need 10,000 Bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1, respectively.

如果一个比特币是100美元，你想以100美元的价格从印度人那里买东西，你需要买1个比特币才能把100美元送到印度。如果比特币的价格是1美分，那么你需要1万个比特币才能把100美元汇到印度。它们分别表示为1:1和10000:1的压缩比。

The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 Bitcoin.The price of Bitcoins _is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted_, in the same way that zip files do not 'care' what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of Bitcoin does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very 'high'.

同样的100美元价值被发送到印度，不管你使用的是1万还是1比特币。比特币的价格与被传输的价值无关，就像zip文件不关心里面的内容一样;比特币和zip是一种功能强大的哑巴协议。只要比特币的价值不降为零，那么它跟价格高时具有相同的效用。

Bearing all of this in mind, it's clear that [new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into][19] and out of Bitcoin would be needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature, before "The Transformation" when Bitcoin becomes money itself because everyone wants it, and prefers it to fiat money.

考虑到所有这些，很明显，在比特币成为货币本身的“转型”之前，需要新的服务来促进比特币的快速、无摩擦的转换，使其能够以符合其本质的方式运行，因为每个人都希望比特币成为货币，并且更喜欢它而不是法定货币。

The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin's nature correctly. They are using the Twentieth Century model of stock, commodity and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user, a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from Bitcoins. Whilst this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value.

目前的交易模式没有正确地解决比特币的本质问题。他们使用的是 20 世纪的股票、大宗商品和货币交易模式，并将其叠加到比特币上。与这些交换接口是非常重要的，对于普通用户来说，这是一个令人生畏可怕的前景。在某些情况下，你必须等上7天才能收到你从比特币账户中取出的法定货币的转账。虽然这不是交易所的过错，但它代表了一个非常现实的障碍，阻碍了比特币发挥其本质作用并提供其全部价值。

Imagine this: you receive an email from across the world, and are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then _apply _to your ISP to have this email delivered to you, and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mail box.

设想一下:您收到一封来自世界各地的电子邮件，并通过在浏览器中显示主题行得到通知。然后你向你的 ISP 申请把这封邮件发送给你，你必须等 7 天，直到它到达你的物理邮箱。

![][21]

The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever.

这种想法是完全荒谬的，然而，这正是比特币正在发生的事情，没有任何技术上的原因。

It is clear that there needs to be a re-think of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a re-think of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurialism and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress.

很明显，我们需要重新思考围绕比特币发展起来的服务，以及比特币的真正本质是什么。重新思考服务是创业精神的正常组成部分，我们应该预料到商业模式会失败，早期进入者会随着不断的迭代和转变方向的进展而半途而废。

Bearing all of this in mind, focussing on the price of Bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; its like putting a methane-breathing canary in a mine full of oxygen breathing humans as a detector. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out, when all is actually fine.


考虑到这一切，使用不适合这种新软件的商业模式来关注比特币在交易所的价格是不理性的;这就像把一只呼吸甲烷的金丝雀放在一个装满呼吸氧气的人类的矿井中作为探测器。即使空气没有问题，鸟儿还是死了；矿工们匆忙撤离，把暴露在外的金矿留下，以为一切都将被消灭，而实际上一切都很好。

![][23]
Day traders speculating on Bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. It's an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for Bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce.

短线交易员在家中对比特币进行投机，导致价格波动。这是一个人为的信号，与比特币的需求无关，也与比特币作为促进商业的经济工具的流通无关。

Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the clients, installing wallets and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious, in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones and instant messaging seem like second nature.

比特币以及它背后的理念将一直存在。随着下载客户端、安装钱包并使用它的人数(如Hotmail)的增加，它最终将达到临界规模，然后在互联网上呈指数级传播。当这种情况发生时，正确的商业模式就会自然而然地出现，就像它们变得显而易见一样，就像 Hotmail、Gmail、Facebook、移动电话和即时消息似乎是第二天性一样。

In the future, I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of Bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing [easy-to-use Bitcoin services that take full advantages of what Bitcoin is][24].

在未来，我想很少有人会对比特币的价值进行投机，因为即使这是可能的，甚至是有利可图的，但提供[易于使用的比特币服务，充分利用比特币的优势][24]也会带来更多的利润。

One thing is for sure: speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The startups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of Bitcoin is bound to stabilise, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin.

有一件事是肯定的:速度将是未来任何比特币商业模式的核心。在交易双方都能提供即时满足的初创公司才会成功。尽管比特币价格的波动肯定会企稳，因为它本身没有任何用处，在任何建立在比特币基础上的业务中，立即回到货币或商品将是一个受欢迎的特征。

The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon.

比特币业务的需求在性能、安全性和新思维方面提供了许多挑战。这些挑战将带来新的实践和软件，我们只能在它们出现的时候想象它们。

Finally, when there is no more fiat, and [the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin][25] has been abolished, then everything will be priced in Bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than Bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like [a reaction's reagents reaching equilibrium][26]. You can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over, and you're left with the spent reaction products.

最后，当没有了菲亚特，菲亚特和比特币之间混乱的过渡区被废除，那么一切都将以比特币定价，也不会有波动，因为除了比特币，没有人会用别的东西来买卖。如果你知道任何化学，这就像一个反应的反应物达到平衡。你可以随意摇晃和搅拌;反应结束了，剩下的是反应产物。

Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, Bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volumes. It can expand to what for many is an _unimaginably_ high price, and then shrink down again. We're seeing this right now, with the "large" swings reported at the small number of exchanges specialising in price discovery.

现在，与世界上的菲亚特(fiat)相比，比特币可以在很大范围内迅速扩张和收缩，因为它的体积很小。它可以扩张到对许多人来说是难以想象的高价格，然后再次收缩。我们现在看到的就是这种情况，少数专注于价格发现的交易所出现了“大幅”波动。

As Bitcoin gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, Bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon. There is a long way to go to achieve this, and the correct way to measure progress is by the number of Bitcoin users, not the price on exchanges.

随着比特币变得越来越大，积累了更多的质量(其价格以菲亚特(fiat)表示)，这些波动将变得越来越小。经历了这一切，比特币仍然完全一样;是它的用户发布了数字作为回应的信号。实现这一目标还有很长的路要走，衡量进展的正确方法是根据比特币用户的数量，而不是交易所的价格。
