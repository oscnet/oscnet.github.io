[This is just the beginning][6].
[Bitcoin][7] is a very new technology, even though the concept that it brings to life is decades old. The _Double Spending Problem_ has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital certificate to stand in the place of money and be sure that no one else can spend that certificate other than you as long as you hold it. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the full implications of which are not yet completely understood, and for which the tools to exploit it do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea.
This new technology requires radical new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email didn't correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed, and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous.

[比特币][7]从出现到现在虽然已经过了十多年，但是它背后所使用的技术，到今天仍然还是非常新颖。_双花问题_的解决，意味着可以使用“数字证书”来代替金钱，并且只要您持有证书，那么除了您以外，其它任何人都不能花这个钱。这是史无前例的范式转换，它所具有全部含义，还不能完全被人理解，并且尚没有可用的工具能充分利用这一新思想。

当开发基于这项新技术的企业应用时，我们需要激进的新思维。如同电子邮件的顶级供应商一样，他们并没能正确地理解他们卖了很多年的服务。有关比特币新的正确的思想是不可缺的，而且在未来它们还会进一步显现出来。使这项新技术能够充分发挥其潜力，并无处不在。

![原来的 Hotmail 界面][9]原来的 Hotmail 界面

Hotmail used familiar technologies (the browser and email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been superseded by web interfaces and email "in the cloud" that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage.

Hotmail 使用熟悉的技术（浏览器和电子邮件）访问和传输邮件的一种更好的方式；使用电子邮件客户端像Outlook Express中的想法已经被“云”，在自己的本地存储在一个专用的客户端提供了许多优势与您的邮件网络接口和电子邮件所取代。

Bitcoin, which will completely transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about Bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other, but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. These fundamental innovations are not simple substitutions or one dimensional improvements of existing ideas or services.

比特币，这将完全改变你汇款的方式，需要在它自己的方式来理解，而不是仅仅为钱在线表格。关于比特币的思考金钱是荒谬的有关电子邮件的发送通过邮寄信件的另一种形式的思维;一个不仅取代了其他的，但它深刻地改变了人们发送和接收消息的方式。这些根本性的创新不是简单的替换或现有的想法或服务​​的一项维改进。

As I have explained previously, [**Bitcoin is not money**][10]. Bitcoin is [**_a protocol_**][11]. If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can put Bitcoin in a proper context, which will allow you to make rational suggestions about the sorts of services that might be profitable based on it.

正如我前面所解释的，[**比特币不是钱**] [10]。比特币[** _协议_ **] [11]。如果以这种方式对待它，用正确的假设，你可以把比特币在适当的情况下，这将让你做出对各种各样的服务，在此基础上，可能是有利可图的合理化建议。

Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilized nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights.

比特币的每一个部分是文本。它始终是文字，从来没有在任何时候不再是文本。这是一个事实，作为文本，它是在文明国家有保证的，不可撤销的权利，宪法的言论自由条款的保护。

If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money, then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it should not be the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an "Email Exchange" to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin.

如果比特币是一个协议，而不是金钱，然后设立货币兑换模仿真实世界的货币，股票和商品的交流，贸易，它不应该是发现其价格的唯一手段。你不会设立“电子邮件交流”发现的电子邮件服务的价值，同样的道理也适用于比特币。

Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your 'letter'. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internets, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on the screen of your recipient's machine, which can be literally any device, from a wristwatch to a laptop a smartphone or a desktop.

与此思路，当你在电子邮件上的Gmail帐户键入住，你输入你的“信”。你按发送，它通过你的ISP，通过互联网络，为您的收件人的ISP，然后是你的收件人机器的屏幕，这可以为几乎任何设备上输出，从手表到一台笔记本电脑，智能电话或桌面。

The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the Bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your [value across the globe][14] to its recipient it needs to be 'read out', i.e. turned _back into money_, in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email.

同样是比特币的真实;您在通过服务一端，然后输入汇款的比特币给收件人，没有中介办理过户。一旦比特币确实[世界各地值]移动你的自己的工作[14]它的接收者它需要“读出”，即变成_back到money_，以同样的方式，您的信件显示其收件人的电子邮件。

In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the block chain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of Bitcoin is _services _or _goods _not Bitcoin itself.

在电子邮件的情况下，一旦发生转移和电子邮件您收到传达其信息给你，它没有其它用途，而不是成为被发送（占）信息的记录，并存档这些信息。比特币不上你的块链这核算，建立在将在本地存储扩展的交易明细给你一个很好的服务，但是你需要有作为的Bitcoin的收件人是_services _or _goods _not比特币本身的东西。

This will remain true until Bitcoin is preferred over money, since it has more utility than money. This event is called, "The Transformation", where Bitcoin is chosen over fiat money because it is more useful than money.

直到比特币优于这笔仍将如此，因为它有比金钱更实用。该事件被称为“转型”，在比特币在选择法定货币，因为它比金钱更有用。

Bitcoin's true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding onto it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will become valuable in the future; it doesn't make any sense. Of course, you **_can_** hold onto Bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value **_will_**_ _go up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all Bitcoin economy gets under way.

比特币的真正本质是瞬间的付款方式（尽管不是钱）在世界任何地方。这是不是一种投资，并持有到它希望这将成为宝贵的是喜欢抱着到电子邮件或希望一个PDF它将在未来成为有价值的;它没有任何意义。当然，你** _可以_ **稳守比特币，看它的价值上升，其价值** _会_ ** _ _go，但你需要有胆量天气的销售和购买的暴力波作为过渡到全比特币经济下的方式获得。

Remember also that businesses that have a need to store Bitcoin need to be concerned about its value if their models are open-ended and are exposed to the market. "Closed Circuit Bitcoin" models have control over everything and never need to worry about prices at exchanges. They can do all their business moving an unlimited amount of fiat with just a few Bitcoin.

也请记住，有需要存储比特币需要企业予以关注它的价值，如果他们的模式是开放式和暴露于市场。 “闭路比特币”的车型必须高于一切的控制和永远不需要担心在交易所的价格。他们可以做所有的业务，只需几个比特币移动菲亚特无限量的。

Despite the fact that you can't double spend them and each one is unique, Bitcoin has no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value; they're always the same, no matter what anyone thinks about them, like math itself. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because _it behaves like money_, due to the fact it cannot be double spent. Misrepresentation of Bitcoin's true nature has masked Bitcoin's dual nature of being digital and not double-spendable.

尽管你不能花加倍他们每个人都是独一无二的，比特币没有内在价值，不像一本书或任何物理对象。他们不能在欣赏价值;他们总是相同的，不管别人怎么想他们，喜欢数学本身。关于比特币误认为思想已蔓延因为_it行为就像money_，由于它不能被双花。比特币的真实性质的不实掩盖了比特币的的是数字，而不是双均可支配双重性质。

Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a gum?

Razzles。他们开始为糖果，然后结束，一种胶。在你咀嚼它们，他们是谁？一个糖果或口香糖吗？

Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it.

比特币是数字，随着信息，使信息的非稀缺的一切素质。它坐落在物理世界的商品和信息的无限丰富的数字世界之间振荡，完全属于数字世界，但同时具有的特征一个新的地方。这就是为什么它被广泛误解，为什么需要一种新的方法来设计它周围的企业。

All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying Bitcoin at the exchanges **doesn't matter for the consumer. **If the cost of buying a Bitcoin goes to 1¢ This doesn't change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your Bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the Bitcoin when you started the process.

所有这一切都在某种程度上解释为什么在交易平台购买的Bitcoin **的价格不为消费者没关系。 **如果购买比特币的成本变为1¢这并不改变货币，在转移的另一端出来的量。只要您兑换比特币转移到任何商品或货币后，相同的值在另一端出来，不管什么您支付了比特币，当你启动的程序。

Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with [zip][17]. The size of a document file when it is "zipped" can be [up to 87% smaller][18] than the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of Bitcoin at an exchange.

想想看，这种方式。让我们假设你要很长的文本文件发送给其他人。您可以把它作为它，或者你可以用[拉链] [17]压缩。当它是一个文档文件的大小“压缩”可以是[小高达87％] [18]比原来的。当我们转这个想法比特币，压缩比比特币的交换价格。

If a Bitcoin is $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 Bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of Bitcoin is 1¢ then you need 10,000 Bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1, respectively.

如果比特币$ 100，和你想购买从别人的东西在印度的100 $你需要购买1比特币来获取$ 100到印度。如果比特币的价格是1¢，那么你需要万比特币送$ 100美金到印度。这些将被表示为1的压缩比：分别为1：1和10,000。

The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 Bitcoin.The price of Bitcoins _is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted_, in the same way that zip files do not 'care' what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of Bitcoin does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very 'high'.

同一$值100发送到印度，无论你用1万1比特币的价格Bitcoin.The无关_is到正在transmitted_值，在ZIP文件不“关心”里面是什么，他们以同样的方式;比特币和拉链是做了工作哑协议。只要比特币的价值不会变成零，就会有相同的效用，就好像价值非常“高”。

Bearing all of this in mind, it's clear that [new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into][19] and out of Bitcoin would be needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature, before "The Transformation" when Bitcoin becomes money itself because everyone wants it, and prefers it to fiat money.

轴承所有的这一点，很显然，[新服务，以方便快速，无摩擦转化成] [19]和流出的Bitcoin将需要允许它的方式，是真实的本质功能，之前的”转型”当比特币成为金钱本身，因为每个人都需要它，而且它更法定货币。

The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin's nature correctly. They are using the Twentieth Century model of stock, commodity and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user, a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from Bitcoins. Whilst this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value.

交易所目前的商业模式没有正确处理比特币的性质。他们使用的是股票，商品和货币兑换的二十世纪模型，这个叠加到比特币。这些交流的接口是不平凡的，而对于普通用户，一个可怕的前景。在某些情况下，你必须等待长达七天接收传送到您的法定货币的帐户从比特币已经兑现了之后。虽然这不是交易所的故障，它代表着一个非常现实的障碍比特币行事的性质，并提供其完整的价值。

Imagine this: you receive an email from across the world, and are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then _apply _to your ISP to have this email delivered to you, and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mail box.

想象一下：你从世界各地收到一封电子邮件，并通过所显示的主题行中您的浏览器通知的事实。然后，您_apply _TO您的ISP有此电子邮件发送给你，你必须等待七天它在你的身体信箱到达。

The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever.

这种想法是完全荒谬的，然而，这正是与比特币发生的事情，因为没有技术理由任何责任。

It is clear that there needs to be a re-think of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a re-think of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurialism and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress.

显然，需要有一个重新思考的是周围的Bitcoin增长服务的，具有可重新想起了什么比特币的本质是沿。反思服务是创业精神的一个正常组成部分，我们应该期待的商业模式失败和早期进入者在路边的不断迭代和旋转进步下跌。

Bearing all of this in mind, focussing on the price of Bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; its like putting a methane-breathing canary in a mine full of oxygen breathing humans as a detector. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out, when all is actually fine.

轴承全部考虑到这一点，使用一种商业模式，不适合这种新的软件根本是不理性的交流集中于比特币的价格;它像把甲烷呼吸金丝雀在一个充满氧气呼吸人类作为探测器的矿井。鸟模具，即使没有什么是错的空气;矿工匆匆撤离，留下暴露的金接缝的背后，以为他们都将被消灭，当一切实际上是罚款。

Day traders speculating on Bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. It's an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for Bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce.

当日交易者从家里投机比特币导致价格振荡。它是无关与比特币的需求及其作为经济工具，以促进商业流通的人工信号。

Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the clients, installing wallets and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious, in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones and instant messaging seem like second nature.

比特币，和它背后的想法是在这里留下来。随着人们下载客户端，安装钱包，并用它增加，如Hotmail的数字，它最终会达到临界质量，然后通过互联网传播呈指数。当发生这种情况时，正确的商业模式将会自动出现，因为它们会变得明显，同样的方式，Hotmail服务，Gmail，Facebook和移动电话和即时消息似乎是第二天性。

In the future, I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of Bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing [easy-to-use Bitcoin services that take full advantages of what Bitcoin is][24].

在未来，我想，很少有人会猜测比特币的价值，因为尽管这是可能的，甚至是有利可图，就会有更多的钱提供[易于使用比特币的服务，要进行取比特币的就是全优点] [24]。

One thing is for sure: speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The startups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of Bitcoin is bound to stabilise, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin.

有一两件事是肯定的：速度将在未来比特币的商业模式的精髓。提供了有关该交易的两端即时满意的初创公司是会取得成功的人。即使比特币的价格波动势必会企稳，因为它没有使用在其本身，又回到了货币或物品瞬间将建成后的比特币任何业务的特性的追捧。

The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon.

比特币企业的需求提供的性能，安全性和新的思维方面具有许多挑战。出于这些挑战会来新的实践和软件，我们只能想像，因为他们来在地平线上。

Finally, when there is no more fiat, and [the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin][25] has been abolished, then everything will be priced in Bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than Bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like [a reaction's reagents reaching equilibrium][26]. You can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over, and you're left with the spent reaction products.

最后，当没有更多的菲亚特和[菲亚特与比特币之间混乱的过渡地带] [25]已被废除，那么一切都将售价在比特币，而不会再有波动，因为没有人使用什么比比特币等买或卖。如果您知道任何化学，这将是像[反应的试剂达到平衡] [26]。你可以动摇它搅拌它所有你喜欢;反应结束，你留下了余下的反应产物。

Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, Bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volumes. It can expand to what for many is an _unimaginably_ high price, and then shrink down again. We're seeing this right now, with the "large" swings reported at the small number of exchanges specialising in price discovery.

眼下，相比于菲亚特在全球的数量，比特币可以非常迅速的扩张和收缩在大范围内，因为它是体积小。它可以扩展到什么很多是_unimaginably_高的价格，然后再缩小了下来。我们现在看到的这种权利，与“大”摇摆报道在少数交流专业价格发现的。

As Bitcoin gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, Bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon. There is a long way to go to achieve this, and the correct way to measure progress is by the number of Bitcoin users, not the price on exchanges.

随着比特币变得更大和更累积质量（菲亚特表示它的价格），这些波动会越来越小。通过这一切，比特币仍然是完全一样的;这是它的用户被发布数字作为一个信号时发生反应。还有很长的路要走，以实现这一点，正确的方法来衡量进步是比特币用户的数量，而不是在交易所的价格。
